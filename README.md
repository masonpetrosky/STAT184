# STAT184
This repo contains my final project for STAT184.
I took historical MLB season-level data from fangraphs.com and converted this into fantasy points and some other things.
Rubric Goals:
Your data is publicly available -  10/10 because the data was attained from a public website and contains 11,153 records in the batting table alone, more than the 10,000 required for full credit in this section.
Your data is complicated - 5/5 because the data contained the batters, starting pitchers, and relief pitchers tables and these were all merged together through the process.
You calculated new variables - 10/10 because I calculated points, points per game, and total bases.
You merged data from separate tables - 5/5 because I merged the original tables.
You made a new tidy table - 5/5 because I created the Pirates table which was a new table with a different level of organization than the original table, similar to the Flights dataset we used in class.
You used 3 plots to support your analysis - 15/15 because I created a plot for each original table vs time. The graphs are the PDFs that I have uploaded.
You have documented your code in Github - 10/10 because it's in here.
You have organized all your code into functions - 15/15 because my code is all within functions, but I also provided the original code in case there is any confusion.
Your project incorporates a statistical analysis or machine learning - 20/20 because this project is entirely an analysis of previous baseball statistics and converting them into points for fantasy baseball.
